        "description": "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The _Small Arms Guide_ is a sourcebook for **Twilight: 2000** which contains a consolidated listing of every personal firearm in the basic game, as well as additional material of interest to both players and referees.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to player requests, the single entry for the generic pistols (such as the 9mmP Auto) of the basic rules has now been expanded to include every major handgun type in use by the year 2000 and encompasses the full sweep of technological change, ranging from the German Luger and \"Broomhandle\" Mauser pistols of the early 1900s to the advanced materials and technology of the Austrian Glock 17. Also described are weapons not yet in service or just entering service (such as the Ruger P85), and hypothetical extensions of current firearms technology.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increased coverage of both military and civilian rifles is also presented in the _Small Arms Guide_. Submachinegun coverage now includes all major types, from the Tommygun of the 1920s to the most modern suppressed designs, such as the H&K MP5 and Ingram MAC-10.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each weapon entry contains an illustration of that particular firearm, a few short descriptive remarks, and full details for the incorporation of the weapon into the game.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The _Small Arms Guide_ expands the ammunition covered in **Twilight: 2000**, including the ever-popular .357 and .44 magnum rounds.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guide also includes a consolidated price and equipment listing for all weapon and ammunition types covered in **Twilight: 2000**. Special essays in the _Small Arms Guide_ cover topics such as reproduction black-powder firearms and the special low-tech auto-rifle, the M16EZ.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The _Small Arms Guide_ is a valuable resource for both players and referees of **Twilight: 2000**, and for anyone who has an interest in modern firearms.",

        "description": "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_It came as quite a surprise when we finally confirmed it. What remained of the big brass in Europe decided that it was time for everyone to get out of the pool, so they arranged for a few ships to take us back to America. Problem was, nobody believed that the ships would have enough room for everybody. We decided that this was the last ride going our way, and it was time to go home. The ships were leaving on November 15, and there were no reserved seats...what with thirty or forty thousand people looking for seats, it could get to be quite a game of musical chairs._\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Going Home_ is an adventure for use with GDW's World War III role-playing game, **Twilight: 2000**. In _Going Home_, the players are presented with the challenge with getting across most of Poland and north-central Germany to catch the last ship heading back to the US for quite a while.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the players choose to remain in Europe, _Going Home_ will still be of tremendous interest. The adventure contains:<ul><li>A full-color pull-out map, covering northern Germany which overlaps with the full-color Poland map included in the original game.</li><li>A referee's update of the location and strength of NATO and Warsaw Pact units in their winter quarters as the year 2000draws to a close.</li><li>A brief rundown of French units in the occupied area west of the Rhine and a discussion of French military activities in the so-called \"dead zone\" east of the Rhine. Also, a bonus: descriptions (in _Twilight: 2000_ terms of three French helicopters.</li><li>Details and specifications, in _Twilight: 2000_ terms, the German Leopard III and the British Challenger tanks, and British 120mm rifled gun.</li></ul>",

        "description": "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_To the survivors of the US 5th Division, Krakow sounded like a city out of a fairy tale...a castle, an evil king, even a flying carpet. Krakow seemed an island of peace in a war-torn world._\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_The reality was different..._\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_The Free City of Krakow_ is an adventure module for **Twilight: 2000**. Krakow has been spared the worst of the war's devastation, and has declared itself a free city. The war is banished, and individuals are free to come and go...so long as they leave the war behind.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This module is more than just a single adventure, however; it is a richly detailed setting for dozens of adventures. It contains a detailed description of the city of Krakow and its environs in the year 2000.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background material includes street maps with points of interest noted, from Wawel Castle to the \"Wojo\" munitions plant. Over a dozen important non-player characters are described in detail. The Krakow ORMO and the marauder bands in the surrounding countryside are detailed as to manpower, equipment, and deployment. The city's economy and the atmosphere of life there form an important part of the module.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using this as a backdrop, the module lays out several adventures which can take place in or around Krakow, and suggests more. The main adventure, \"Operation Reset,\" thrusts the characters into the midst of intrigue and treachery, and brings them to the attention of most of the interesting (read: dangerous) citizens of Krakow.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the module contains rules for incorporating helicopters into **Twilight: 2000**. Krakow's defense forces have an operational Mi-17 Hip (Krakow's \"flying carpet\"). Complete statistics on this helicopter are given along with those for the Mi-27 Hind E, Mi-20 Havoc, OH-57 Kiowa AHIP, UH-60 Blackhawk, and AH-64 Apache.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_The Free City of Krakow_is an exciting adventure, but it's more than that. It's a gateway to a deeper, richer understanding of the world of **Twilight: 2000**.",

Most countries were hit hard in the nuclear exchange, but no one had a decisive advantage, and the war went on. Tanks began breaking down and the supply of spare parts gradually dwindled to zero. The sophisticated artillery weapons have shot off all of their ammo, and no one is capable of producing any more. Divisions which started with 20,000 men are lucky to put 2000 in the field.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, the war goes on.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are part of the remnants of the leading U.S. division of NATO's last drive into Central Poland. There isn't much in the way of organized military forces left on either side, and the local warlords, militia and murderous bands of marauding deserters rule the countryside. Your division has been overrun and your group is hundreds of kilometers from the nearest friendlies.

        "description": "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_I don't know why I stayed with the team. They offered to let any of us out who wanted out - just say so and you're a civilian. But then the chief gave us a pitch about how we came through the war without a loss because we worked as a team, and how we might be able to help the authorities rebuild our country by staying together. We were all a little euphoric over being back in the states after so many years on the sharp end. Frankly, if I'd known what was doming up, I think I'd have stayed overseas._\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_The Last Submarine_ is a game module for use with GDW's World War III role-playing game, **Twilight: 2000**. The story centers around a group of characters operating out of the remains of New London, Connecticut. This lucky group must attempt to recapture the USS _City of Corpus Christi_, a _Los Angeles_-class, fast attack submarine which has somehow found its way into the hands of a New England warlord. The warlord has managed to scrape up the necessary spare parts to repair the boat, a moderately knowledgeable crew to do the repairing and sail her once she is repaired, and a nefarious scheme which will seriously upset governmental plans along the whole eastern seaboard. The players must locate the _Corpus Christi_, capture her intact, and return the boat to New London for further orders.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information presented in this module includes source material for the region of souheast New England, background material on the _Corpus Christi_, a brief history of submarine actions in the Atlantic, and six programmed adventure sessions.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_The Last Submarine_ is the first module in a trilogy of **Twilight: 2000** adventures which will carry the _Corpus Christi_ and her crew on an exciting odyssey across the Atlantic and through the Mediterranean, and will culminate in an exciting encounter in the frozen wastes of the far north. The adventures will surprise and amuse players and referees alike.",

        "description": "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Easy money, he says. Nothing to worry about, he says. A simple little trip down the river, straight into Warsaw, and collect our reward, he says._\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Then why are all these people shootin' at us?\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Pirates of the Vistula_ is an adventure module for **Twilight: 2000**. The mighty Vistula River sets the stage for a journey from Krakow to the remains of Warsaw aboard the river gut _Wisla Krolowa_. But the Vistula has seen better days. The river has been left untended for years as the war raged around it, and now is overcome with debris and sandbars.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the important forces along the river, such as the bandit and marauder unitrs and, of course, the vicious river pirates, who virtually rule the river itself, are described in terms of organization, equipment, and motivations.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The module itself is not just one adventure, but several. Together they represent life along the river, such as it is after the nearly complete destruction left in the wake of the war. Separately, they provide many adventures, from rescuing cities from tyrannous marauders to choosing sides between warring bandit kings to simply staying alive as the river pirates draw ever nearer.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, _Pirates of the Vistula_ provides complete rules for a new type of warfare in the world of **Twilight: 2000** - riverine combat. New rules allow the resolution of river battles quickly and easily.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Pirates of the Vistula_ gives a rich, detailed look at the entire course of the upper Vistula and its environs, just one small section in the war-ravaged world of **Twilight: 2000**.",

I don't believe in ghosts, but I wouldn't go down in that hole for all the gold in Poland!\"_\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_The icon known as Our Lady of Czestochowa (commonly called the Black Madonna because of the dark patina which covers it) is the symbol of Poland's relitious, cultural, and national identity. For centuries the icon's image has been a rallying standard of Polish nationalism, of Polish independence._\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_To some men, the Madonna was a light that would lead Poland from the darkness. To others, however, the Madonna represented a different kind of hope. The owner of the Madonna could command the lyalty of the Polish people. To these men, the Madonna represented power and wealth beyond imagining._\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_It was all a question of who found her first._\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_The Black Madonna_ is an adventure module for **Twilight: 2000**. Silesia, in southern Poland, is the backdrop for a quest for a religious icon of great value. Was the icon taken east by the Soviets? Was it hidden in a cave by  Polish patriots? Was it destroyed when Czestochowa was bombed? Did the NATO forces who occupied the city briefly carry it west with them? Or, does it rest beneath the ruins of Czestochowa? There is only one way to know for sure...\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and above the main adventure, this module provides a picture of life in southwest Poland after the destruction of the war. The surviving cities, the resources, the petty lordlings and the major powers are given life and detail. From the court of the Markgraf of Silesia to the camps of the bandit gangs; from the ruined factories of Czestochowa and Gliwice to the slowly recovering facilities of Raciborz and Rybnik; all are described in rich detail.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_The Black Madonna_ is another expansion and addition to the growing world of **Twilight: 2000**.",

Even those whose campaigns are not set in the United States want to know what happened to their home town, or how far the Soviets managed to get in Alaska, or what areas are controlled by New America.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Howling Wilderness** is a sourcebook of the United States of America for use with **Twilight: 2000**, GDW's WWIII role-playing game. It describes the events in America during the years leading up to the war. It describes the preparations for nuclear attack taken by the government, and why many of those preparations failed. It describes the attack upon the United States in November of 1997, and the aftermath of that attack. In addition, it carries the **Twilight: 2000** future history through May of 2001, and summarizes conditions in the U.S. as of that date. It will also deal with the shift in weather patterns in late 2000 / early 2001, and the effects this will have.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Howling Wilderness** contains the following:<ul><li>Discussions of the status of Civgov, Milgov, and New America, including current territories as of 2001, a summary of available military forces, and a brief history of each in the years from 1997 to 2001.</li><li>Maps showing the location of each major nuclear strike and details of the more important ones.</li><li>A state-by-state rundwon of local conditions, concentrating upon what effects the drought will have on each.</li><li>This sourcebook also contains a special bonus: _Twilight Citymaker_. This is a collection of geomorphic map sections of various urban areas. We have provided a nice selection of geomorphic sections (over 100 different ones) for referees to photocopy. Using these geomorphs, referees can put together villages, towns, and fortified strongpoints at a moment's notice, or make them up quickly and easily ahead of time.</li></ul>",

The question of where we were going wasn't foremost on our minds, though. Why was what we wanted to know. What was so flamin' important about some commie satellite?_\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Here's the answer we got, verbatim: \"Because that little electrtronic box recorded every action of the war - every nuclear strike, as well as the most current and up-to-date information on wind patterns and radiation spread over the whole damn world, not to mention ozone dispersion and other weather data. Whoever has this satellite will be years ahead of the other nations in terms of knowing the extent of the climatic changes coming up.\"_\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_As it turned out, the most important question, which none of us asked, was \"Who?\"_\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In **Satellite Down**, the characters get to take a trip to sunny Baja California, where they must retrieve some data cassettes from a weather / recon satellite that managed to record the weather patterns of the last three years. Whoever has the informaiton on those tapes will be able to forecast the effects of the climatic changes caused by the war - and be better able to survive them. The only thing standing in their way is a do-it-yourself messiah and a few hundred fanatic followers.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Satellite Down** contains all the information a referee needs to conduct the adventure, including maps, building floor plans, and historical background on the satellite and the religious community which has recovered it.",

        "description": "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warsaw had been nuked, and nuked hard. Nearly everyone there had been killed. But still, the ruins had things to offer - raw materials such as metal and stone, and protection from the marauders who surrounded it.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things drew the settlers, but they also drew the Baron Czarny, and his evil army of cutthroats.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Ruins of Warsaw_ is an adventure module for **Twilight: 2000**. Warsaw was levelled by six NATO nuclear devices in 1997. The city itself was in ruins, smashed into dust and debris. And the people were dead. Those who survived the blast were killed in the firestorm or by the disease and starvation which followed. Practically no one is alive who remembers the event.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But time has passed.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the rads died away, the settlers moved in. The city, even in its current state, provided some protection against the bandits who ruled the countryside. They dug up the old city parks, exposed them to the light of day for the first time in three years, and planted their crops. They cleared away the debris in order to survive, using it as the raw materials for homes, tools, and defenses.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black Baron came to Warsaw, as well. At the head of his terrible legion of marauders, Baron Czarny moved into the city, taking as his own the former Palace of culture and Sciences. From this new _Twierdza Czarny_ (black fortress), the evil Baron commands his horde to pillage and subjugate everyone in and around the city. Only one group still holds out against him in strength - the _Milicya of Sielce_.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The player characters have become involved in the battle for Warsaw, between the Baron and the _Milicya_. As some of the few men with military training and experience, they will play leading roles - commanding troops, ambushing convoys, contracting other communities, and trying to survive in the rubble and debris of Warsaw.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in _Ruins of Warsaw_ are the complete macro combat rules for **Twilight: 2000**. Now battles involving hundreds of men and vehicles may be resolved quickly, easily, and realistically.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle for Warsaw has begun. Are you prepared to win it?",

We have to save western civilization again, right?\"_\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_We all thought Ski was crazy. \"We are the last hope of civilization in Poland,\" he said. \"Julian is a dictator. Krakow is run by a bunch of gouging, mercantile profiteers. There are bandits everywhere, and the only one who cares about Polish people is Father Wojiech. We have to help him - it's the only way to keep everything from sliding into the pit.\"_\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_All of us in the squad argued for hours. I said helping Father Wojiech is insane and is only gonna get us all killed.

Guess._\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In **White Eagle**, powerful forces are struggling to control a nation. The armed might of King Julian of Silesia is matched against the equally powerful econiomic force of the free city of Krakow. Opposing them both is the Wojsko Ludowa (People's Army) of Father W. Niekarz. Krakow has mercantile connections, money, and technological expertise. Teh \"king\" has military expertise and a steadily expanding government of local warlords backed by an organized military. Father Niekarz and his followers have a devo8ut belief in the righteousness of their cause, a burning desire to see Poland free of tin-pot dictators and petty warlords backed by \"soldiers\" who are more than bandits -  and the Black Madonna of Czestochowa, a religious icon and a powerful symbol of Polish nationalism.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the WL's banner, Father Niekarz has chosen a white eagle (the traditional symbol of Poland) on a red field (red and white are the Polish national colors). The People's Army has no stockpiles of weapons and ammunition, no vast treasury, no great military leaders. That's where you come in...\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**White Eagle** outlines whathas happened in southern Poland since the players last saw the region: the transmutation of General Julian Filipowitz into the despotic King Julian, the power struggle within Krakow for control of the region's industrial economy, the deteriorating agricultural situation that threatens to spark another round of civil unrest within the towns and villages of Poland - these factors and other threaten the fragile blossom of civilization.",

Over the winter, the threat gone, the small communities fell to squabbling among themselves. This spring, the baron is back, with a new army, and once again threatens the communities that have taken root in the ruins of the former capital of Poland. The baron plans to conquer the communities before the winter wheat crop is ready, while the defenders are still short of food.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The characters have been asked for help by Filip Kizysztof, leader of the Sielce settlement. Filip needs the characters' aid in reuniting the splintered communities to defeat the baron a second time, and in the process save what's left of civilization in this part of Poland.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This booklet contains:<ul><li>Revised streetmaps of the relevant portion of downtown Warsaw.</li><li>Updated histories of the Warsaw communities and the baron.</li><li>Orders of battle for the various combatants, including the remnants of the Soviet 10th Guards Tank Division.</li><li>Information for adapting the larger battles for resolution using Last Battle, GDW's new boardgame of modern and future close combat.</li></ul>",

        "description": "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iranian Crown Jewels. For years they rested in the vaults of the Markasi Bank in Tehran, where they backed Iran's legal tender, but when the National Emergency Council governing Iran in mid-1996 abandoned Tehran and retreated to Esfahan, they took the Crown Jewels with them.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first half of 1997, the NEC elected to move again, this time from Esfahan to Shiraz. The Iranian Crown Jewels were left behind just long enough for preparations to be made to secure them in Shiraz. Other considerations, such as the fact that even Shiraz became cut off by further Soviet advances, soon occupied the Council's collective mind.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as Esfahan looked in imminent danger of falling to the Soviets, a desperate mission to move the Crown Jewels was launched. The mission never returned; Esfahan was quickly captured by Soviet forces; and the Crown Jewels were lost in the shuffle. The Soviets assumed that the National Emergency Council had them. The Council believed that they had been captured by the Soviets. But rumors began to circulate that the jewels had simply _disappeared_.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In _King's Ransom_, the players learn that someone has found the Crown Jewels and a desperate race begins to beat the KGB to the jewel's hiding place.",

        "description": "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Land's End to Dover, from the Channel Islands to the Shetlands, the Survivors' Guide to the United Kingdom describes what happened to the United Kingdom during the war and afterward. It explains just what the word 'England' means in 2000, discusses the fate of the North Sea oil platforms, and gives you the lowdown on organizations ranging from H.M. Government to the Soviet GRU.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Survivors' Guide contains a detailed order of battle for the British Army, updating previous versions and implementing several major changes, bringing the OB up to 1 January 2001. It presents British-oriented character generation tables and a consolidated reference for British military equipment, including many obsolete vehicles and weapons found in use only by local militias and marauder bands. Every major weapon is covered - from the Humber \"Pig\" and the Ferret AC up to the most advanced MBT -- with every gaming aspect fully detailed.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Survivors' Guide describes a country on the mend, desperately trying to restore order to a people who have had almost every semblance of government and society shattered by global warfare. H.M. Government controls only a portion of the country; the rest consists of an intricate tapestry of independent cities, petty dictatorships and broad bands of territory ruled only by brigands and marauders. A district-by-district description details what was nuked, what was destroyed by rioters, and the other damage inflicted by the war and the civil dislocation which followed.",
