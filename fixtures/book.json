        "description": "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_It came as quite a surprise when we finally confirmed it. What remained of the big brass in Europe decided that it was time for everyone to get out of the pool, so they arranged for a few ships to take us back to America. Problem was, nobody believed that the ships would have enough room for everybody. We decided that this was the last ride going our way, and it was time to go home. The ships were leaving on November 15, and there were no reserved seats...what with thirty or forty thousand people looking for seats, it could get to be quite a game of musical chairs._\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Going Home_ is an adventure for use with GDW's World War III role-playing game, **Twilight: 2000**. In _Going Home_, the players are presented with the challenge with getting across most of Poland and north-central Germany to catch the last ship heading back to the US for quite a while.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the players choose to remain in Europe, _Going Home_ will still be of tremendous interest. The adventure contains:<ul><li>A full-color pull-out map, covering northern Germany which overlaps with the full-color Poland map included in the original game.</li><li>A referee's update of the location and strength of NATO and Warsaw Pact units in their winter quarters as the year 2000draws to a close.</li><li>A brief rundown of French units in the occupied area west of the Rhine and a discussion of French military activities in the so-called \"dead zone\" east of the Rhine. Also, a bonus: descriptions (in _Twilight: 2000_ terms of three French helicopters.</li><li>Details and specifications, in _Twilight: 2000_ terms, the German Leopard III and the British Challenger tanks, and British 120mm rifled gun.</li></ul>",

        "description": "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For five years, the armies of the world have fought back and forth across Europe. Three years ago the missiles started flying. Most countries were hit hard in the nuclear exchange, but no one had a decisive advantage, and the war went on. Tanks began breaking down and the supply of spare parts gradually dwindled to zero. The sophisticated artillery weapons have shot off all of their ammo, and no one is capable of producing any more. Divisions which started with 20,000 men are lucky to put 2000 in the field.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, the war goes on.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are part of the remnants of the leading U.S. division of NATO's last drive into Central Poland. There isn't much in the way of organized military forces left on either side, and the local warlords, militia and murderous bands of marauding deserters rule the countryside. Your division has been overrun and your group is hundreds of kilometers from the nearest friendlies. The last message from division headquarters read:\n\n<center>**GOOD LUCK.**</center><center>**YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.**</center>",

        "description": "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened in the United States from 1997 to 2001 is a question of interest to almost every referee and player of **Twilight: 2000**. Even those whose campaigns are not set in the United States want to know what happened to their home town, or how far the Soviets managed to get in Alaska, or what areas are controlled by New America.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Howling Wilderness** is a sourcebook of the United States of America for use with **Twilight: 2000**, GDW's WWIII role-playing game. It describes the events in America during the years leading up to the war. It describes the preparations for nuclear attack taken by the government, and why many of those preparations failed. It describes the attack upon the United States in November of 1997, and the aftermath of that attack. In addition, it carries the **Twilight: 2000** future history through May of 2001, and summarizes conditions in the U.S. as of that date. It will also deal with the shift in weather patterns in late 2000 / early 2001, and the effects this will have.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Howling Wilderness** contains the following:<ul><li>Discussions of the status of Civgov, Milgov, and New America, including current territories as of 2001, a summary of available military forces, and a brief history of each in the years from 1997 to 2001.</li><li>Maps showing the location of each major nuclear strike and details of the more important ones.</li><li>A state-by-state rundwon of local conditions, concentrating upon what effects the drought will have on each.</li><li>This sourcebook also contains a special bonus: _Twilight Citymaker_. This is a collection of geomorphic map sections of various urban areas. We have provided a nice selection of geomorphic sections (over 100 different ones) for referees to photocopy. Using these geomorphs, referees can put together villages, towns, and fortified strongpoints at a moment's notice, or make them up quickly and easily ahead of time.</li></ul>",
